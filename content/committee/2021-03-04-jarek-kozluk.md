position: Publishing Editor
short: pubs
bio: "Hello there! It's me your publishing editor this year. I was born in
  Warsaw, Poland and somehow my path has led me to the blooming city of Dublin.
  Now some facts about me: I like travelling, Middle Eastern Culture and FOOD
  (Iranian tea with Saffron is delicioussss), reading Ancient comedies,
  especially Aristophanes, and Philosophy. If you have any questions I'm eager
  to help! Looking forward to seeing you in Trinity :>"
