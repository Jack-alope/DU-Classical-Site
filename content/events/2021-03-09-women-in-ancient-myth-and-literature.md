As International Women's Day kicks off we are thrilled to announce the event of the week. The theme of the night is "Women in Myth and Literature" in collaboration with DU Gender Equality Society. 

The best bit about it is you're all welcome to present a PowerPoint on the theme! This is a very informal thing so if your talk comes in the form of a PowerPoint, song, rant, or Kahoot we are down for it!
