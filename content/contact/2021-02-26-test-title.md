The College Classical Society is the place for all those interested in the classical worlds of Greece & Rome, whether that means reading Homer or watching 300.

Highlights include trips abroad (recent destinations include Rome & Pompeii) and our legendary black-tie Imperial Ball. Thereâ€™s something for everyone, so get involved as we enter our 115th session!
